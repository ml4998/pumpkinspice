            <h1>20 Years Later, Pumpkin Spice Sales Reach $800 Million, But It’s Not Because People Are Buying More</h1>

        <p>For twenty years, pumpkin spice-flavored items have signaled the unofficial start to autumn and it has ballooned into a $802.5 million industry according to NielsenIQ data for the 52-week period ending in July 2023. 
            </p>

        <p>But this is not because of an increase in unit sales of pumpkin spice goods, as one would think. During the same period, the number of products sold went down by 1.5 percent, the second straight year it has done so. What then is driving up dollar sales?

</p>

<p>Pumpkin Spice Latte originally came from <a href="tories.starbucks.com/stories/2023/psl-turns-20-the-story-behind-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/">Starbucks </a> in 2003 when Peter Dukes, the leader of the Starbucks espresso beverage team at the time, created the company’s first fall beverage. 

<p>According to Jin-A Choi, associate professor at Montclair State University, Pumpkin Spice Latte was first introduced as a test in about 100 stores across Washington D.C.
</p>

<p>Choi added that PSL was not as popular among consumers at first. But after 20 years, the trend continues to expand from lattes to scented candles, and now pumpkin spice-flavored dog treats. 

</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’ve seen this craze until like eight years ago, and I think as more big-name brands have jumped on it [the trend], it has grown,” Choi said.

</p>

<p>While the trend continues to expand within markets, this is not reflected in the number of units being sold thus creating a discrepancy between the dollar sales and unit sales for 2023. There are several theories that explain the discrepancy.</p>

<p>Consumers Are Paying More for Pumpkin Spice Products</p>

<p>Just as the number of products continues to rise, so has the price of pumpkin spice products. Which brings us to the first theory for the increase in dollar sales: pumpkin spice products are more expensive each year.</p>

<p>Starbucks raised the price of its Pumpkin Spice Lattes by 12 percent in 2022 and added another 50 cents to the standard 16-ounce fall latte this year per a report by <a href="tories.starbucks.com/stories/2023/psl-turns-20-the-story-behind-starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/">The Krazy Coupon Lady. </a>
    
</p>

<p>According to Jadrian Wooten, a collegiate associate professor of economics at Virginia Tech, general labor costs associated with the food service industry have increased throughout the years. </p>


<p>“Labor costs have increased over the past couple years especially at places like <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/28/will-starbucks-union-busting-stifle-a-union-rebirth-in-the-us"> Starbucks </a> Starbucks Wooten said. </p>

<p>“Unionization is part of it but then also just general labor costs associated with the food service industry has increased a lot especially since the pandemic so that’s just gonna translate to higher sale numbers and mostly because that cost is pushed on to consumers themselves,” he added.</p>

<p>Apart from unionization, Wooten adds that the increase in labor costs has roots in some of the challenges COVID-19 posed for businesses, namely the supply-chain issues.</p>

<p>“At first, you think about something like Starbucks doesn't seem like it fits with that, but it's even things like shipping coffee from South America is harder and more expensive because of all the COVID-related stuff that was going on, sort of ports being shut down,” Wooten said. </p>

<p>More than an opportunity for retailers to make a profit, the price increase also serves as a buffer against higher labor costs and discourse around tipping, according to Wooten. </p>

<p>Another factor that Wooten thinks is at play when it comes to higher prices is inflation. 

</p>

<p>“You're looking at 4 or 5, 6% inflation [from the last couple of years] and so it's a much more obvious increase in prices than what it was before. So it's not necessarily super surprising to see sort of flat unit sales despite increasing sort of overall sales numbers,” Wooten said.</p>

<p>The 3.7% US inflation rate has affected everything from the price of eggs in the grocery store to the cost of a cup of coffee. A 16-ounce pumpkin spice latte from Starbucks now costs 4% more than it did in 2021, according to a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/29/business/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte-2022/index.html"> CNN report. </a> </p>

<p>Aside from Starbucks, retailers have also come to take advantage of the seasonal trend. Grocery stores have marked up the cost of pumpkin spice products by an average of 14.1% according to <a href="https://www.magnifymoney.com/news/pumpkin-spice-study/"> a report by Magnify Money in 2022. </a> The report also showed that the largest pumpkin spice-related markup that year is 161.1% for Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Spiced Teeny Tiny Pretzels which cost 50 cents an ounce.  </p>

<p>But this has not deterred consumers from buying pumpkin spice products. <a href="https://www.montclair.edu/school-of-communication-and-media/2023/09/28/montclair-study-starbucks-still-dominates-the-pumpkin-spice-social-media-conversation/"> A study </a> by Montclair State University shows that in 21,000 social media posts from August 27 to September 25, 2023, 45% of social media users are feeling positive about pumpkin spice products, with only 5% feeling negative. The remaining 50% of the posts were deemed neutral.</p>

<p>Dr. Yi Luo, an associate professor in the School of Communication and Media at Montclair State University said price is not an issue for pumpkin spice lovers.</p>

<p>“In our discussion, the price hasn’t come up in either the major topics or trending topics so if you’re a pumpkin spice lover, you don’t care about the prices. You still get it,” Luo said.</p>

<p>Artificial pumpkin spice is not counted in the data on unit sales</p>

<p>Luo thinks it’s possible that retailers and manufacturers wanted to reduce the cost so they started incorporating artificial pumpkin spice in items but these items were not added in the data on unit sales.</p>

<p>“Maybe the profit from the sales of pumpkin spice counted the revenue/profits from artificial pumpkin; whereas the current data for pumpkin spice only considered the natural pumpkin spice without factoring in the artificial pumpkin spice”, Luo said. “So the increased profits might have included profits from both artificial and natural pumpkin spice.”</p>

<p>Unit sales and consumer interest</p>

<p>For the second straight year, unit sales of pumpkin spice products have seen a decline, according to NielsenIQ. The 1.5% decrease in unit sales for the period ending in July 2023, however, does not translate to a decline in consumer interest, according to Wooten. </p>

<p>“I would mostly say that it is not necessarily waning interest but rather they [consumers] have more options,” Wooten said. </p>

<p>Starbucks expanded its seasonal brew this year with the addition of Iced Pumpkin Cream Chai Tea Latte and apple-flavored Espressos and croissants. Meanwhile, <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/fall-menu-2023"> Dunkin </a> reintroduced the Pumpkin Spice Signature Latte to its patrons along with its Nutty Pumpkin Coffee, Pumpkin Swirl, and Pumpkin bakery line-up.  </p>

<p>“Customers have more options and so in some sense before they would have gotten a Pumpkin Spice Latte once a week, now they get it every other week because they're filling in something in between,” Wooten said. </p>

<p>Starbucks revenues rose by 12% to $6.9 billion from July to September 2023. The coffee giant reported that fourth-quarter net revenues are up by 11% to a record $9.4 billion in <a href="https://news.dunkindonuts.com/news/fall-menu-2023"> a press release </a> </p>


<p>Aside from coffee, pumpkin spice sales are said to have been doing well in grocery store chains. Cameron, a manager at Trader Joe’s on 72nd Street, said that this year sales have been higher than last year and that all seasonal products usually sell out within the first couple of weeks of fall. She added that sometimes the demand is so high that products will sell out before Halloween. </p>

<p>“Some of the most popular products include mostly cookie and candy products like Scotty Cookies and JoJo,” she said. </p>

<p>Team Trainer at Whole Foods on 63 Madison Avenue, Fernando Rodriguez, said that the most popular pumpkin spice products at Whole Foods stores include coffee creamers and cake mixes.</p>

<p>“Pumpkin spice is our major seller, and coffee creamer is one of the most popular because everyone is trying to get the pumpkin spice latte,” Rodriguez said.

</p>

<p>Target stores are no different in terms of selling out pumpkin spice products.</p>

<p>Isabel Mendoza, manager at Target on the Upper West Side on 98th St. and Columbus, said, “they’re doing really, really well… We’d get the shipment in the morning and sell out about an hour and a half or two hours after that,” Mendoza said. 
</p>

<p>Some consumers express feeling ‘pumpkin spice fatigue’</p>

<p>But this is not to say that some consumers do not feel the so-called pumpkin spice fatigue. </p>

<p>According to Dr. Luo, just like with any other product, some people are going to grow out of pumpkin spice products because of the intensive marketing and commercialized message about pumpkin spice. </p>

<p>“15% of these sort of neutral and negative sentiments in our study, they [consumers] talk about frustration or fatigue about pumpkin spice like ‘oh, my God, pumpkin spice again,’” Luo said. </p>

<p>Every year companies roll out pumpkin spice products earlier and earlier to increase their revenue and draw out the pumpkin spice season as long as they can, according to Dr. Choi. She said that having longer pumpkin spice seasons can cause consumer fatigue. </p>

<p>“If companies are releasing pumpkin spice in August when it’s still hot, people are going to feel fatigue even before fall,” Choi said.</p>

<p>However, according to Wooten, this year pumpkin spice was not released as early compared the previous years.</p>

<p>“It usually was launched earlier and earlier, but I think this year they moved it a little bit later. I think like last year, they probably realized that it was too early, you know?” Wooten said.</p>

<p>Wooten said the foreseeable future of pumpkin spice is not consumer fatigue, but rather more businesses jumping on the trend such as McDonalds and Chick-fil-A.</p>

<p>“I think you’re going to start seeing them offer more than one menu item across their space as well,” Wooten said. “So not just in like a pumpkin spice portion but also like in their winter offerings [and] in their spring offerings.”</p>

<p>Choi also offers a promising outlook for pumpkin spice products and argues that one cannot escape pumpkin spice because businesses will continue to capitalize off of the trend as it is a strong moving force that drives consumerism. </p>

<p>“It’s so ingrained in American culture that fall does not arrive without the arrival of pumpkin spice,” Choi said. “Whether you want to be a part of it or not, it’s here.”</p>

<p>“I’m not even talking about the difference between private and public hospitals. The difference will be much more stark when talking about the public and the private sector,” Perceleay said
</p> 

<p>Public hospital workers in New York city legally cannot strike, which makes it challenging for residents under the Health and Hospitals system to fight for their rights. Despite this, residents were able to speak up about the issues through social media and unity breaks.
</p>

<p>“We were standing outside the hospitals, but we have not heard anything from the city about trying to get us a contract,” Perceleay said. 
</p>

<p>When it comes to the impact that the pay disparity has on resident doctors, Percelay said residents are trying to not let the frustration impact the quality of care they provide for their patients. However, it still impacts them in some ways. 
</p>

<p>“The busier we are, we have to do ‘out of title work,’ such as transporting patients, drawing blood, etc. and it takes up time. Especially since we are folks who are supposed to be leaning, it definitely take away time from learning,” she said.
</p>

<p>Percelay also added that not being compensated fairly affects the quality of life of residents in terms of whether or not they are able to afford to live in New York City. 

</p>

<p>“At the end of the day, we are also worried about how our lease is coming up—‘am I going to be able to afford to stay here?’ Especially with inflation, needing to move farther away from the hospital because you can't afford to live closer to the hospital. We don't get paid overtime when we end up staying late to help with patients. Obviously, we're happy to do all those things for our patients but it’s like pouring from an empty cup at the end of the day,” she said. 


</p>

<p>Aside from the salary disparities, Percelay also touched on some of the other conditions that made residents’ lives more difficult. 
</p>

<p>“Some of the hospitals don’t even have cafeterias anymore. At some of the hospitals, people are working overnight, and there is no access to food,” she said. 
</p>

<p>Percelay added that residents have gotten a lot of support from the nurses association but ultimately, mayor Adams is the one who makes decisions. </p>

<p>“But in terms of responses from, Health and Hospitals, I think some of the, the CEO’s have said that they're willing to back us, but ultimately we're asking for Mayor Adams since he's the one who could really make movement here to get us a fair contract, And we have not heard anything from Mayor Adams,” she said.</p>

<p>Percelay said that one of the contributing reasons to pay disparity is the split payroll issue. Split payroll system means that residents in some hospitals are funded by Health and Hospitals whereas others are funded by private institions such as NYU. 
</p>

<p>“You are not really able to choose which one [sponsoring organization] you get, and you do the exact same job and you might end up getting paid $5,000 less just randomly,” Percelay said. 

</p>

<p>Dr. Marimer Rivera-Nieves, a resident from Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, touched on the specifics of her expired contract. She said that her contract expired in 2021, meaning that since she is not under a new contract yet, she’s still getting paid the amount that was agreed upon in her previous contract. 
</p>

<p>“We used to get a 3% increase [in salary] per year. And throughout the year, it has to match up to what other hospitals are doing. So currently, many residents are getting paid, for example, [Mount] Sinai residents are getting paid over $80,000. Meanwhile, even the highest class of residents in our hospital are under $80,000,” Rivera said.
</p>

<p>Rivera also talked about the impact the pay disparity has had on patient care and said that she and her coworkers pride themselves in not letting their personal life affect patient care, but ultimately it does affect them.
</p>

<p>“Having a salary that might not meet the needs that we have to pay rent, buy food, and to do our own medical expenses, it does take a toll. And sometimes it makes residents have to figure out. Am I buying food or do I can pay for therapy? Because mental health affects us all,” Rivera said. 

</p>

<p>According to Rivera, Residents make at least 60% of the physicians in hospitals, which means that residents carry a lot of positions in hospitals.
</p>

<p>“we have a very high volume, hospital. That means we're constantly working nonstop, so we also deserve to be able to fund ourselves and have the money where I could go to sleep knowing that I'm going to be okay and I'm going to pay my rent and I'm going to be able to buy groceries,” Rivera said. 
</p>

<p>Dr. Donald Hathaway, Lincoln resident doctor, said that residents reached out to the CEO’s of different hospitals and are asking them for support. They have also made social media posts to raise awareness and talked to local officials, congress members, and borough residents. However, Mayor Adams still remains the ultimate decider in this situation. 
</p>

<p>“We have gotten overwhelming support from elected officials… They’ve been hopeful that that support will take us across the finish line,” Hathaway said. 
</p>

<p>“I am fortunate enough to not be working at one of the hospitals where there's people working side by side with me, making more than I am for doing the exact same job. But I can only imagine how demoralizing that would be,” Hathaway said.
</p>

<p>Aside from these issues, Hatwhay pointed out how the pay disparity will contribute to public hospitals not being able to recruit the best talent from medical schools due to the fact that future residents are concerned about the cost of living in New York City.
</p>

<p>“It's really tough to explain to someone why you should come to a public hospital and accept $5,000 to $10,000 less than they could make at a private hospital in New York City. People aren’t really enticed to do the same job for less money, especially when the the general belief and understanding of working in New York City is that working in the public hospital system is pretty difficult,” Hathaway said. 
</p>

<p>Hathaway added that NYC H + H residents used to be some of the best paid residents in the city. 
</p>

<p>“We've we've been paid competitively, and now we've lost that competitive edge because now we will be making the least in the city. And I do think this will be the first time we see that decline in recruitment,” Hathaway said.
